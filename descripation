📌 ESP32 Web-Based LED Control (SoftAP Mode)

This project demonstrates a standalone ESP32 web server that controls two LEDs through a browser-based interface without requiring any external Wi-Fi router or internet connection.

The ESP32 operates in Soft Access Point (SoftAP) mode, creating its own Wi-Fi network. Any nearby device (mobile or laptop) can connect directly to the ESP32 and control the LEDs using on-screen buttons. The LED states and button labels update dynamically between ON and OFF.

🔑 Key Features

ESP32 runs as a Wi-Fi Access Point

No router, no internet, no external SSID/password required

Web-based control using any browser

Two independent LEDs with real-time ON/OFF status

Simple, lightweight HTML interface

Ideal for college projects, demos, and IoT fundamentals

🛠 Technologies Used

ESP32

Arduino IDE

WiFi.h

WebServer.h

HTML & CSS (embedded)

📡 How It Works

ESP32 creates a Wi-Fi network (SoftAP mode)

User connects to ESP32 Wi-Fi from phone/laptop

Web server runs at http://192.168.4.1

Button clicks send HTTP requests to ESP32

ESP32 toggles LED states accordingly
